### RTXData Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: October 3, 2023**

This Privacy Policy describes how RTXData (“we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and safeguards information obtained from users (each, a “User”) of the rtxdata.github.io website (“Site”) and RTXData browser extension for Chrome (“Extension”), and any services offered in connection with the Site and Extension (collectively, the “Services”).

**1. Information We Collect**

Our Services allow users to analyze spending in Raiffeisen Bank (Serbia). The Extension enables the gathering of transaction data from Raiffeisen Bank, Wolt (a food delivery service), Glovo (a food delivery service), and upload this data to the Site. We collect information that could identify an individual, such as financial and location data, stored locally on the user’s device, and do not transfer it to any servers or third parties, except as stated below in Section 2. 

**2. Use of Information**

We primarily use the information collected to provide and improve the Services and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Extension. If a user selects transaction classification through AI, anonymized references of transactions will be transferred to our server for classification. This only occurs with explicit user confirmation.

**3. Data Storage and Sharing of Information**

All the user data gathered by our Services by default is stored locally on the user’s device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers, ensuring the privacy and security of user data. We do not share user’s personal, financial, and location information with third parties unless the user has explicitly confirmed to utilize the AI classification feature. Even in such a case, the transaction data is anonymized to protect user privacy. That data may be used for classifier improvement that is publicly available.

**4. User Consent**

By using the Services, Users agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Users are asked for explicit confirmation before any data is transferred for AI classification. 

**5. Data Protection Rights and User Control**

Given that the user data is stored locally on the user’s device, users have full access to their information and can manage it using their browser's tools. Users have the right to access, correct, update, or delete their personal information at any time through their browser settings or any interface provided by the service for managing data. While we may provide a convenient interface for managing this data, we are not obligated to do so, and users are ultimately responsible for managing their information through the available browser tools and interfaces.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. While we may post the new Privacy Policy on the Site, it is the user’s responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about any changes. Users interested in receiving direct notifications about updates can do so by subscribing to our GitHub repository at https://github.com/rtxdata/rtxdata.github.io. By staying subscribed to our repository, users can ensure they are aware of the most current terms of our Privacy Policy.

**7. Contact Us**

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us by sending a pull request to our GitHub repository at https://github.com/rtxdata/rtxdata.github.io or by opening an issue.

**8. Governing Law**

This policy and the use of the Services are governed by the laws of Serbia. If a dispute arises, users agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Serbia.

By using RTXData Services, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Services. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
